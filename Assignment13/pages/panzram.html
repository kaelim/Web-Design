            <h1>Carl Panzram</h1>
            <b></b>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <em>Carl Panzram was born on June 28, 1891, on a farm near East Grand Forks, Minnesota, the sixth of seven
                children born to East Prussian immigrants Johann "John" Gottlieb Panzram and Mathilda Elizabeth "Lizzie"
                Panzram (née Bolduan[1]). Panzram and his six siblings were made to work on the family farm from a young
                age until truancy laws, which made it illegal for parents not to send their children to school, came
                into effect.

                Panzram's parents were very angry about having their children sent to school during the day and forced
                them to work in the fields throughout the night instead; Panzram later reported he would get just two
                hours of sleep before he would have to get up for school. Punishments in the household also ranged from
                being chained to being starved. Panzram reflected on his early childhood with the sentiment that he was
                not liked by other children; by the age of five he claimed that he was a liar and thief, and he recalled
                that he became meaner the older he grew.[2] Panzram's father abandoned the family when he was 7 years
                old. Eventually, four of his five older brothers left as well; one of them drowned.
                Panzram's run-ins with the law started in 1899, at age 8, when he was charged in juvenile court with
                being drunk and disorderly, and in 1903, at age 11, he was arrested and jailed for being drunk and
                "incorrigible," a term used when detaining youths.[3] Not long after this second arrest, Panzram stole
                cake, apples, and a revolver from a neighbor's home. In October 1903, Panzram's mother sent him to the
                Minnesota State Training School, purportedly a reform school; Panzram later wrote in his autobiography,
                however, that he was repeatedly beaten, tortured and raped by staff members, in a workshop the children
                dubbed "the paint shop" due to leaving the room "painted" with bruises and blood. Panzram hated the
                school so much that he decided to burn it down, and did so successfully and without detection on July 7,
                1905.[2]: 11 [4]

                In January 1906, Panzram was paroled from Red Wing Training School, where he had been detained after
                stealing money from his mother's pocketbook.[5][6] By his early-teens Panzram exhibited alcoholism and
                had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, mostly for burglary and robbery offenses. At age 14, a couple of weeks
                after his parole and two weeks after attempting to kill a Lutheran cleric with a revolver,[fn 1] Panzram
                ran away from home to live on the streets. He often traveled via train cars, and later recalled having
                been gang raped by a group of homeless men on one of these occasions.

                <h2>Crimes</h2>
                <em>In the summer of 1906, Panzram was arrested for burglary in Butte, Montana, and sentenced to one
                    year's imprisonment at Montana State Reform School in Miles City. He claimed that after a guard
                    punished him, he assaulted and critically injured the man with a wooden board. As punishment,
                    Panzram had to spend some time in solitary confinement. The following year, Panzram and a fellow
                    inmate named James Benson escaped from Montana State Reform School and stole guns in Terry, Montana.
                    In the coming weeks, Panzram and Benson repeatedly broke into stores and razed buildings, especially
                    churches, to the ground with fire. In Fargo, North Dakota, the two men separated.

                    Later in 1907, after getting drunk in a Helena, Montana saloon, Panzram enlisted in the United
                    States Army and was assigned to the 6th Infantry at Fort William Henry Harrison. Refusing to take
                    orders from officers and being generally insubordinate, he was convicted of larceny for stealing $80
                    worth of supplies and served a prison sentence in the United States Disciplinary Barracks at Fort
                    Leavenworth between 1908 and 1910, with U.S. Secretary of War William Howard Taft officially
                    approving Panzram's sentence. Panzram later claimed that while he had been a "rotten egg" before
                    imprisonment at the military penitentiary, "any shred of goodness left in him was smashed out"
                    during his time at Fort Leavenworth.[7]

                    After his release and dishonorable discharge, Panzram resumed his criminal activities as a thief.
                    Stealing items that ranged from bicycles to yachts, he was caught and imprisoned multiple times. He
                    served prison sentences both under his own name and various aliases in: Fresno, California; Rusk,
                    Texas; The Dalles, Oregon; Harrison, Idaho; Butte, Montana; Montana State Prison; Oregon State
                    Prison; Bridgeport, Connecticut ("John O'Leary"); Sing Sing Correctional Facility, New York; Clinton
                    Correctional Facility, New York; and Washington, D.C. and Leavenworth, Kansas. While incarcerated,
                    Panzram frequently attacked guards and refused to follow their orders. The guards retaliated,
                    subjecting him to beatings and other punishments.[8]

                    In his autobiography, Panzram wrote that he was "rage personified" and that he would often rape men
                    whom he had robbed. He was noted for his large stature and great physical strength—due to years of
                    hard labor at Leavenworth and other prisons—which aided him in overpowering most men;[8] he also
                    engaged in vandalism and arson. By his own admission, one of the few times he did not engage in
                    criminal activities was when he was employed as a strikebreaker against union employees. On one
                    occasion, he tried to sign aboard as a ship's steward on an Army transport vessel but was discharged
                    when he reported to work intoxicated.[7] The last thing that he had stolen before he was caught was
                    a radio.</em>

                    <b></b>
                    Panzram claimed in his autobiography that after escaping from a chain gang sentence at Rusk, Texas,
                    he went to Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, in the winter of 1910 to try to enlist in the Federales. He took a
                    train to Del Rio, Texas, and got off in a small town 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) east of El Paso.
                    He later claimed to have abducted, assaulted, and strangled a man about a mile from town and then
                    stolen $35 from the victim.[9]

                    In the summer of 1911, Panzram, going by the alias "Jefferson Davis", was arrested in Fresno,
                    California, for stealing a bicycle. He was sentenced to six months in county jail, but escaped after
                    thirty days.[10] Panzram later claimed that after his escape, while riding on a boxcar in
                    California, he disarmed an armed man he either called a "railway detective" or a "railway brakeman",
                    whom he then forced to rape a homeless man at gunpoint, before throwing both of them off the train.
                    He proceeded to Oregon, where he made a living as a logger.

                    Panzram admitted years later that once, when hiding in a bordello, his wallet was stolen and he was
                    infected with gonorrhea; he also became paranoid. In 1913, Panzram, going by the alias "Jack Allen",
                    was arrested in The Dalles, Oregon, for highway robbery, assault, and sodomy. He broke out of jail
                    after two months. He was later arrested in Harrison, Idaho, but again he escaped from county jail.
                    He was again arrested in Chinook, Montana, and sentenced to one year in prison for burglary, to be
                    served at the Montana State Prison.
                    On April 27, 1913, Panzram, using his "Jefferson Davis" alias, was admitted to the Montana State
                    Prison at Deer Lodge, Montana. He escaped on November 13. Within a week, he was arrested for
                    burglary in Three Forks, giving his name as "Jeff Rhoades". He was incarcerated at Deer Lodge for an
                    additional year. By his own account he committed sodomy while imprisoned. Panzram was released on
                    March 3, 1915, with a new suit of clothing, $5 and a ticket to the next town six miles away. He rode
                    the rails through Washington, Idaho, Nebraska and South Dakota via the Columbia River. On June 1, he
                    burglarized a house in Astoria, Oregon, where he was soon arrested while attempting to sell some of
                    the stolen items.
                    Under the name "Jeff Baldwin", Panzram was sentenced to seven years in prison, to be served at the
                    Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, where he was taken on June 24, 1915. 50-year-old Warden Harry
                    Minto believed in harsh treatment of inmates, including beatings and isolation, among other
                    disciplinary measures. Later, Panzram stated that he swore he "would never do that seven years and I
                    defied the warden and all his officers to make me."[8] Later that year, Panzram helped fellow inmate
                    Otto Hooker escape from the prison. While attempting to evade recapture, Hooker killed Minto. This
                    event marked Panzram's first known involvement in a murder, as an accessory before the fact.[8] In
                    his prison record which noted his two alias "Jefferson Davis" and "Jeff Rhodes", he falsely gave his
                    age as 30, and his place of birth as Alabama. His only truthful statement was when he stated his
                    occupation as "thief".
                    <b></b>
                    Panzram was disciplined several times while at Salem, including sixty-one days in solitary
                    confinement, before escaping on September 18, 1917. After two shootouts, in which he attempted to
                    shoot Chief Deputy Sheriff Joseph Frum, he was recaptured and returned to the prison. On May 12,
                    1918, he escaped again by sawing through the bars of his cell,[11] and caught a freight train
                    heading east. He began going by the name "John O'Leary" and shaved off his mustache to change his
                    appearance. Panzram would never return to the Northwest.[8] Panzram allegedly ended up in New York
                    City, got a Seaman Identification card, and sailed on the steamship James S. Whitney to Panama.
                    There he tried to steal a small boat with the help of a drunken sailor, who killed everyone on board
                    and was arrested. Still free, Panzram travelled to Peru to work in a copper mine. After that, he
                    traveled to Chile, Port Arthur, Texas, London, Edinburgh, Paris, and Hamburg.

            <h2>Murder Spree</h2>
            <p>
                In 1920, Panzram committed a robbery in Newport, Rhode Island. On September 16, 1920, he burglarized the
                Taft Mansion in New Haven, Connecticut, a residence of William Howard Taft, by that time a former
                President. Panzram specifically targeted the mansion out of animus he had been holding against Taft
                since his incarceration at Fort Leavenworth. He stole a large amount of jewellery and bonds,[fn 2] as
                well as Taft's Colt M1911 .45-caliber handgun.[13]

                Using Taft's stolen money, Panzram bought a small sailing yacht, the Akista, and embarked on an
                8-year-long murder spree which spanned several countries and involved multiple victims. Sailing south to
                New York City, for three months Panzram lured sailors away from port bars onto the yacht, made them
                drunk before raping them, and then murdered the men with Taft's stolen pistol, subsequently dumping
                their bodies near Execution Rocks Light in Long Island Sound. In this manner Panzram claimed to have
                killed ten men.[14] The sailor murders ended only after Akista ran aground and sank near Atlantic City,
                New Jersey, during which his last two potential victims escaped to parts unknown.[15] On October 26,
                Panzram was arrested in Stamford, Connecticut, for burglary and possession of a loaded handgun. In 1921,
                he served six months in jail in Bridgeport, Connecticut.[16]

                Panzram caught a ship to Southern Africa and landed in Luanda, the capital of colonial Portuguese
                Angola. In 1921, Panzram was foreman of an oil rig in Angola. He later burned it down out of what he
                said was "spitefulness". Shortly after, he decided to seek out a virgin girl.[2] Panzram paid a resident
                Angola family 80 eschudas (US$8) and, in exchange, was given a 12-year-old girl, whom he raped in his
                shack later that night. He returned the girl to her family demanding his money back on suspicion of the
                girl not being an actual virgin. The family then gave Panzram an 8-year-old girl, whom he also raped in
                his shack, but who was eventually taken back to the family because he suspected that she too was not a
                virgin. He then claimed that he raped and killed an Angolan boy estimated to be 11-or-12-years-old. In
                his confession to this murder, he wrote: "His brains were coming out of his ears when I left him and he
                will never be any deader." He also claimed that he hired a boat with six rowers, shot the rowers with a
                Luger pistol, and threw their bodies to the crocodiles.[7]

                After his return to the United States, Panzram asserted he raped and killed two small boys,[7] beating
                one to death with a rock on July 18, 1922, in Salem, Massachusetts,[fn 3][18] and strangling the other
                later that year near New Haven.[fn 4] After his murder spree in Salem, Panzram worked as a night
                watchman in Yonkers, New York, north of Manhattan, at Abeeco Mill factory. In Providence, he stole a
                yawl and sailed to New Haven, seeking victims to rob and rape, and boats to steal. In June 1923, in New
                Rochelle, New York, he stole a yacht belonging to the police chief of New Rochelle. He picked up a
                15-year-old boy named George Walosin and promised him a job on the boat, but instead sodomized him.

                On June 27, on the river near Kingston, New York, Panzram claimed he picked a man up but then believing
                the man was going to attempt to rob him, Panzram used a .38 caliber pistol from the stolen yacht to kill
                the John Doe victim. Panzram threw the body into the river.[10] On June 28, Panzram and Walosin docked
                at Poughkeepsie, New York. Panzram stole $1,000 worth of fishing nets. At Newburgh, New York, Walosin,
                having witnessed the murder the day before, jumped overboard and swam to shore. He reported to the
                police at Yonkers that he had been sexually assaulted by Panzram. An alert went out for "Captain John
                O'Leary". On June 29, "John O'Leary" was arrested in Nyack, New York.

                On July 9, Panzram tried to escape from jail. He later conned his lawyer by giving him ownership of a
                stolen boat in return for bail money. Panzram skipped bail, and the boat was confiscated by the
                government agents. On August 26, "O'Leary" was arrested in Larchmont, New York, after breaking into a
                train depot. Three days later, on August 29, "O'Leary" was cleared as a suspect in the stabbing death of
                Dorothy Kaufman of Greenburgh, New York, committed a month prior.[32] He was sentenced to five years'
                imprisonment.[clarification needed] While in county jail, he confessed to the alias "Jeff Baldwin", and
                that he was wanted in Oregon for the murder of a policeman (Minto). After first being imprisoned in Sing
                Sing Prison, in October, Panzram was imprisoned at Clinton Prison in Dannemora, New York as Inmate
                #75182. While there he tried to escape but ended up with a injured spine and broken ankles. He was
                discharged in July 1928, and he allegedly committed another murder that summer in Baltimore, Maryland.

                <h2>Final Capture and Execution</h2>
                <em>
                    On August 30, 1928, Panzram was arrested in Baltimore for a Washington, D.C. burglary – stealing a
                    radio and jewelry from the home of a dentist on August 20. Three men were also arrested as
                    accomplices and most of the jewelry was recovered. Panzram gave his correct name although he lied by
                    claiming his age as 41 and that he was from Nevada.[33] During his interrogation, he confessed to
                    killing three young boys earlier that month – one in Salem, one in Connecticut, and a 14-year-old
                    newsboy in Philadelphia.[30][34][fn 5] Panzram's confession to killing a boy at Pier 28 on League
                    island near Philadelphia in August 1928 was confirmed.[37] Boston police were unable to corroborate
                    his other confession, the murder of a boy in Charlestown, Massachusetts.[38] Panzram later wrote
                    that he had contemplated mass murders and other acts of mayhem, such as poisoning a city's water
                    supply with arsenic, or scuttling a British warship in New York Harbor to provoke a war between the
                    United States and Britain.[7]

                    In light of his extensive criminal record, Panzram was sentenced to 25-years-to-life. Upon arriving
                    at Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary, identified as inmate #31614, he warned the warden: "I'll kill
                    the first man that bothers me". Because he was considered too psychotic he was assigned to work
                    alone in the prison laundry room, where the foreman, Robert Warnke, was known to bully and harass
                    other prisoners under him. Warnke soon antagonized Panzram, despite the latter repeatedly warning
                    him to back off. On June 20, 1929, Panzram beat Warnke to death with an iron bar. He was convicted
                    and sentenced to death.[39] He refused to allow any appeals of his sentence. In response to offers
                    from death penalty opponents and human rights activists to intervene, he wrote: "The only thanks you
                    and your kind will ever get from me for your efforts on my behalf is that I wish you all had one
                    neck and that I had my hands on it."[8]

                    While on death row, Panzram was befriended by an officer named Henry Philip Lesser, who would give
                    him money to buy cigarettes.[40][41] Panzram was so astonished by this act of kindness that, after
                    Lesser provided him with writing materials, Panzram wrote a detailed summary of his crimes and
                    nihilistic philosophy while awaiting execution. Panzram explicitly denied having any remorse for any
                    of his actions[42] and began his journal with the statement that: "In my lifetime I have murdered 21
                    human beings, I have committed thousands of burglaries, robberies, larcenies, arsons and, last but
                    not least, I have committed sodomy on more than 1,000 male human beings. For all these things I am
                    not in the least bit sorry. I have no conscience so that does not worry me.

                    Panzram was hanged on September 5, 1930. As officers attempted to place the customary black-hood
                    over his head, he spat in the executioner's face.[43] When asked for any last words, he responded:
                    "Yes. Hurry it up, you Hoosier bastard; I could kill a dozen men while you're screwing around!"
