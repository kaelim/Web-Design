    <h1>Ranking</h1>
   <p> I have played quite a few games this year and now we are ranking them based on a criteria of...How fun I thought
     it  was! That is mostly based on how pretty it was and if I could play it without wanting to throw my controller.</p>

      Honestly this was the most amazing game and it is still my favorite. The level design is great; it never gets repetitive but never pushes you to the point of frustration. The character design as well is just adorable I mean Look how cute our PC is.
       Also you get to help all of the little forest creature which is just precious. 11/10

     This game was awesome and almost took the first spot due to its absolutely fascinating mechanics. This whole game is based around playing with perspectiev. Basically teh world is exactly how it appears and that can change the very reality you play in. Overall 
     super fun puzzles that make you think in an entirely different way. 10/10

     This game was pretty short but was fun, all the achievements where fun to get and I love a game with a good narrator. Also fun to make the narrator confused/upset.
8/10    </div>

This game is so wonderful and cozy, you go through this game finding lost souls and helping them by solving a variety of puzzles. The atmospher in this game is great and all the NPCs who 
help you along the way are adorable. The level design in this is pretty good and leaves you lots of room to explore and is very forgiving. 7/10

      No list is complete with out the classics, while this game has been out fr quite sometime I always love coming back to it as it is so nostalgic. This one of my all time favorite games
      anyone can pic it up and play, ths is what me and my sister played on our Wii cosnole as kids and it holds a special place in my heart. 7/10
