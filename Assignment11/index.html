    <p>
        The Montana Freemen were an anti-government <span id= "patriotmilitia">Christian Patriot militia</span> based outside the town of Jordan, Montana, United States. The members of the group referred to their land as "Justus Township" and had declared their leaders and followers "sovereign citizens" no longer under the authority of any outside government. They became the center of public attention in 1996 when they engaged in a prolonged armed standoff with agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

        The movement originally referred to the<span id="posse"> Posse Comitatus</span>, a far-right militia organization. The Posse Comitatus followed an ideology based on the teachings of William Potter Gale, who was also a Christian Identity minister, and the majority of the Christian Patriot movement's members still adhere to Christian Identity's white supremacist views. This ideology holds the view that state and federal governments are agents of an arcane conspiracy to deprive Americans of their rights as "sovereign citizens." It also holds the view that this conspiracy can be undermined through various legal pleadings from English common law and other sources, such as a motion protesting the way a defendant's name is typeset in a legal complaint. The ideology persists despite numerous court rulings that have declared its theories frivolous.

        The movement grew during the 1990s after the Ruby Ridge and <span id="waco">Waco Sieges </span> to confirm the suspicions of Christian Patriots. The movement maintained its ties with the American militia movement of the same period. A highly publicized federal confrontation with Christian Patriots occurred in 1996, when Federal marshals arrested the Montana Freemen.

In 2009, the Southern Poverty Law Center said that militia groups may be experiencing a "Patriot revival."</b>
